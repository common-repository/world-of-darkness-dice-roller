A World of Darkness dice roller widget that will let users enter their target number and roll any number of 10-sided dice. The widget displays the number of success and can be customized in the admin for any World of Darkness game or edition.

== Description ==

The World of Darkness Dice Roller lets you spread hope to the diceless masses by providing a virtual dice alternative on any widgetized part of your site. Users can enter their target number (admin can set the default) and enter the number of dice they want to roll. Upon clicking the Roll button the widget outputs the number of successes achieved, as well as displaying the actual result of each of the 10-sided dice.

The World of Darkness Dice Roller can be configured for just about any World of Darkness game or edition, including Vampire: the Masquerade and Vampire: Requiem, Werewolf: the Apopalypse and Werewolf: the Forsaken, Mage, Changling and others (does not currently support Aberrant mega-stats, however). The title of the widget is editable so you can name it appropriate to the game you care most about, or name it anything else you'd like for that matter.

The World of Darkness Dice Roller can be configured for the following:

* Any target number, with default set in the admin
* Exploding 10s: determine whether or not 10s result in rerolls, or allow users to choose on a roll-by-roll basis
* To allow 1s to cancel or not -- if 1s cancel they will cancel 10s first

The World of Darkness Dice Roller will also alert you of botches, using the rule that a botch only occurs when there are no successes and at least one result of a 1. If there are successes -- even if they're all cancelled -- it will not be a botch. We are not using or supporting the early edition botch rules of old World of Darkness. Those sucked.
